 <em><h4>
    It’s a shame that the standard way of learning how to cook is by following recipes.To be sure,<br>
    they are a wonderfully effective way to approximate a dish as it appeared in a test kitchen,<br>
    at a star chef’s restaurant, or on TV.<br>
    And they can be an excellent inspiration for even the least ambitious home cooks to liven up a weeknight dinner.<br>
    But recipes, for all their precision and completeness, are poor teachers. They tell you what to do, but they rarely tell you why to do it.<br>
