# odin-recipes
This project is to build on practicing my basic HTML knowledge that I have learned while doing the Odin project. I will be building a basic recipe website that will have a main index page which will have a few links to a few recipes.

After completing this project, I have accomplished:
<p><ul>
<li>Properly seting up html files accordingly</li>
<li>Linked html files together</li>
<li>Inputed images with alternative text</li>
<li>Created ordered and unordered lists for the steps and recipes</li>
<li>Added in cooking notes by emphasizing them at bottom of the page</li>
<li>Added a Home/main page button on recipes sites to go back to starting page</li>
<li>used body and paragraph elements to describe what the recipe is all about</li>
  <li>Linked a CSS stylesheet to the HTML files</li>
<li>Properly implemented various types of CSS selectors and inheritance, keeping in mind of specificity rules.</li></ul>
